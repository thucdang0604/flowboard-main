"""AI-vision brief generation for cached media.

Asks the configured Vision provider (Claude / Gemini / OpenAI Codex)
to summarise an image into a short factual description ("aiBrief").
Used by:
- Visual asset / character nodes — annotate uploaded or generated images
- Auto-prompt synthesizer — feed those briefs into a downstream prompt

Provider routing goes through ``run_llm("vision", ...)``. The user picks
which one in Settings → AI Providers — there is no default; the forced
setup gate ensures one is chosen before the app is usable. All three
shipped providers support vision, so the registry's vision-capability
gate is currently a defensive no-op — it kicks in if a future text-only
provider is added.

We always pass an ABSOLUTE path so the underlying transport (CLI flag
or HTTP base64) doesn't get tripped up by the agent's cwd.
